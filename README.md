## ToDo
- Add new table train_status attributes train_num, date( FK train), seats booked ac, sleeper & remove these 2 from train. ADVANTAGE- write access will be given for train_status table & train table data will be secure.  
- Triggers
    - Update
        - train_status: 
            - When seats booked = available seats then remove the corresponding tuple from it
            - Now, while booking if a train is released but is booked fully it will not be in train_status table    
    - Insert
        - passenger: check same pnr, coach no & berth no shouldn't be in the table
    
    - Delete
        - Prevent deletion of data of all the tables except train_status 
            
- Finalize schema & update ERD & corresponding changes in code
