## ToDo
- Add new table **train_status** attributes train_num, date( FK train), seats booked ac, sleeper & remove these 2 from train. ADVANTAGE- write access will be given for train_status table & train table data will be secure. 
- From admin-page.php add link to **Check Train status** (input train no & date) display status of train [if not valid o/p message train not released or has been booked]
- Update the link view trains to view all released train in which train details are visible (number, date & available coaches)
- Same for **user page** and **header**
- In view-booking & view-user-booking add **number of passengers** column
- no of passengers attribute should be added to ticket or not?

- Triggers
    - Update
        - train_status: When seats booked = available seats then remove the corresponding tuple from it Now, while booking if a train is released but is booked fully it will not be in train_status table   
        - ticket: PNR cannot be updated
    - Insert
        - passenger: check same pnr, coach no & berth no shouldn't be in the table
